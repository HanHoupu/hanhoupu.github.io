Hi, I'm **Han Houpu**.I have a bachelor's degree in physics and now I'm switching to AI and machine learning.

I haven't started deep or formal study yet, but from what I've seen so far, I'm really interested in building AI that actually works and solves problems. It could be AI for science, LLMs, or even AGI â€” as long as it's useful, I'm motivated to learn.

Right now I'm doing small projects in Python (see the [Projects](/projects/) page).  

My resume is in the [CV](/cv/) page.

*I don't have any publications yet, for now.*
